Use quality microphones suitable for your space and the number of participants, favoring those with noise reduction or directional features to limit undesirable sounds. Test your audio equipment before the conference to adjust levels, avoid distortion, or echoes. Finally, during the conference, regularly monitor audio levels and encourage participants to use headphones to reduce the risk of feedback.',
        'question2' => 'When are surveys on the functioning of audio conferences organized?',
        'answer2' => 'Surveys regarding the functioning of audio conferences are usually scheduled during the session break. You will be notified of the availability of these surveys through a notification directly on the site. They provide a valuable opportunity to collect your feedback, opinions, and suggestions on the audio aspects of the conference. Your active participation in these surveys contributes to continuously improving the quality of our conferences by identifying areas for improvement and addressing the specific needs of our community.',
        'question3' => 'How to resolve audio feedback issues during a presentation?',
        'answer3' => 'Audio feedback, often identified by sharp and unpleasant noises, is generally caused by a feedback loop between speakers and microphones. To avoid it, ensure that speakers are not positioned too close to microphones to reduce the risk of capturing emitted sound. Use anti-feedback equipment or noise reduction software to mitigate these issues. Before any presentation, rigorously test the audio equipment to detect and correct potential problems.',
